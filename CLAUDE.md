# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a **GitHub Pages static website** (ink-hz.github.io) that hosts a personal technical blog at www.ink-hz.cn. The repository contains the **compiled output** of a Hexo 4.2.0 static site generator, not the source files.

## Key Architecture

### Structure
- **Generated HTML files**: Organized by year (2020/, 2021/, 2022/) containing blog posts
- **Static assets**: 
  - `/css/` - Stylesheets (main: style.css)
  - `/js/` - JavaScript files (main: script.js with jQuery)
  - `/fancybox/` - Lightbox library for image galleries
  - `/images/` - Blog images and assets

### Technology Stack
- **Generator**: Hexo 4.2.0 (metadata in HTML comments)
- **Frontend**: jQuery-based JavaScript, Fancybox 2.1.5
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages with custom domain (www.ink-hz.cn via CNAME file)

## Common Development Tasks

### Deployment
```bash
# This repository auto-deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Site updated: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
git push origin main
```

### Working with Content
Since this is a generated site:
- **DO NOT** manually edit HTML files in year directories (2020/, 2021/, 2022/)
- **DO NOT** modify generated index files or archives
- Static assets in `/css/`, `/js/`, and `/fancybox/` can be modified if needed

### Domain Configuration
- Custom domain is set via `/CNAME` file containing `www.ink-hz.cn`
- Changes to domain require updating this file

## Important Notes

1. **This is a deployment repository** - all content is generated by Hexo elsewhere
2. **Commit pattern**: Follow "Site updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" for consistency
3. **No build process** - files are pre-built and ready for GitHub Pages
4. **Chinese content** - Blog is primarily in Chinese (blog title: "千里之行，始于足下")

## File Modification Guidelines

When modifying files:
- **Safe to modify**: `/css/style.css`, `/js/script.js`, `/CNAME`
- **Do not modify**: Generated HTML in year directories, `/archives/`, `/index.html`
- **Be cautious with**: `/fancybox/` (third-party library)

## Typical Workflow

For content updates, the normal workflow would be:
1. Generate new site content using Hexo (in source repository)
2. Copy generated files to this repository
3. Commit with "Site updated: [timestamp]" message
4. Push to deploy via GitHub Pages
